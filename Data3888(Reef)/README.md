**FinalApp_beta:** contains Shiny App and used data
app.R: the Reef Health prediction App 
> *To use the app, due to of the size of the dataset, there might be a quite long loading time (May cost 30s before it shows).*
- Home Page: Red point in the interactive map shows reef which has more than 3 years record. Double click the point to check fishing effort information
- Model Prediction Page: Reef health prediction model & interactive map showing the change in bleaching while adjusting fish catch rate.
- Graph Page: Contains graph shows predicted Reef bleaching rate in the future and linear relationship between selected fish & bleaching.

**MergeData.Rmd:** Contains code for data cleaning and merging
> *Due to the original datasets excess the size limit of GitHub, we cannot upload them. Raw data Could be found in:*
